# FrankBot for Discord

### Welcome to the GitHub repository for the FrankBot source code!
* This bot is written completely in Node.js and has only a few features, but is very open to expansion.

#### Current Features
* Multiplication
* Rolling 1-10000 Dice with a die face range of d2-d10000
* DadBot-like message responses (Responds to messages containing "I'm" or "kys")
* Many more features are to be added to flex my programming skills

#### Adding The Bot to a Server
* If you want the bot on your server click [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=593008720334684160&permissions=6144&scope=bot)

#### Author's Note
* Just be aware this bot is under constant R&D so some functions listed here may not work as intended or at all
* I cannot afford to put the bot on a hosting site so it will only function when my computer is on
* I do not mind if you rip functions from here to your own bot, but don't come to me for help if it doesn't work on your bot
